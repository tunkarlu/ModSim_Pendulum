Experiment Pendulum

***This project is part of AVE3 pratical course for Modelling and Simulation.
The goals are to see how a non-linear mechanical oscillation system behave under the influences of loads with different masses.
Throughout the experiment, the period duration and damping of the oscillation systerm are investigated.
Different modelling approaches (mathematical and physical modelling) are done and the simulation results are validated using the measurements from the experiment.
Parameterisation is done by simple methods of system identification.
